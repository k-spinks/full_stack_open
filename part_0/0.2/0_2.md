# CSS Basics

- CSS controls the **visual appearance** of HTML content.
- HTML = structure; CSS = presentation.

- Styles are applied through **rules**, which include:

  - A **selector** (what to style).
  - **Properties and values** (how to style it).

- The **box model** is foundational:

  - Every element is a box with content, padding, border, and margin.

- CSS lets you control:

  - Typography (fonts, sizes, spacing)
  - Colors and backgrounds
  - Spacing and layout (margins, padding, width, display behavior)

- External stylesheets are the recommended way to apply CSS.
- Good CSS organization separates content from appearance, improving maintainability.

# Form Basics

- Forms collect user input and send data somewhere (usually a server).
- Forms are created with the `<form>` element.

- `action` defines **where** the data goes.
- `method` defines **how** the data is sent (commonly GET or POST).

- Forms are made of **controls**: inputs, textareas, buttons, etc.
- Every control should have a **label** for usability and accessibility.
- Each control needs a **name** so its value is included in the submitted data.

- `<input>` changes behavior based on its `type` (text, email, etc.).
- `<textarea>` is used for multi-line text.
- Submit buttons trigger form submission.

- Forms provide the **structure** and **semantics** for data entry; styling and interactivity come later.

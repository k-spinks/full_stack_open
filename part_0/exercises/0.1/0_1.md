# HTML Basics

- HTML gives **structure and meaning** to web content.
- An HTML page is built from **elements (tags)** that define what each piece of content is.

- A basic HTML document includes:

  - `<!doctype html>` to tell the browser it's HTML5.
  - `<html>` as the root element.
  - `<head>` for metadata (title, character encoding, viewport).
  - `<body>` for everything visible on the page.

- Use semantic elements to organize content properly:

  - **Headings** `<h1>–<h6>` for clear structure.
  - **Paragraphs** `<p>` for blocks of text.
  - **Lists** `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>` to represent grouped information.

- Images are added with `<img>`:

  - `src` points to the file.
  - `alt` provides text alternatives for accessibility.

- Links are created with `<a href="…">` to connect pages or external resources.

- Good HTML structure improves:

  - Accessibility (screen readers rely on semantics)
  - SEO
  - Maintainability
  - How CSS and JS interact with the page

- HTML focuses on **content and structure**, not style or behavior (those belong to CSS and JavaScript).
